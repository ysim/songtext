       -----------
       Don't blame your death on the shit in your head
       That you claimed ate you like a virus for days on end
       I watched you decay, watched you waste away
       Who'd you think you'd fool, baby, diggin' your own grave?

Option values that consist of more than one word need to be quoted:

::

       $ songtext -a 'nina simone' -t sinnerman

       Nina Simone: Sinnerman
       ----------------------
       Oh sinnerman, where you gonna run to?
       Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?
       Where you gonna run to?
       All along dem day

Punctuation is important too:

::

       $ songtext -a "shawn mendes" -t "theres nothing holdin me back"

       Your query did not match any tracks.


       $ songtext -a "shawn mendes" -t "there's nothing holdin' me back"

       ---------------------------------------------
       I wanna follow her where she goes
       I think about her and she knows it
       I wanna let it take control
       'Cause every time that she gets closer
